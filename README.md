# fourier-analysis-synthesis
Fourier analysis and synthesis of a recorded musical note using MATLAB

## Description
In the provided code, the note A4 is recorded using an acoustic piano, and then a Fourier Analysis is conducted to find out the Fourier Series Coefficients for the signal. Then, another signal is generated through Fourier Synthesis using the aforementioned coefficients. 

#### The commented code at the top is used to record the sound file and save it inside the workspace. If you do not have access to or simply do not want to record, you can use the .mat file provided to have access to three different musical notes, A4, G4 and E4.
